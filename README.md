#		*NBIS pipeline collection*
#		########################


NBIS uses lot of pipelines in its everyday work in wide range of bioinformatic area.<br />
Some are directly coded within scripts in different languages (BASH,PERL,PYTHON,JAVA,etc).<br />
Some others are writen within dedicated bioinformatic pipeline frameworks (bpipe, snakemake, etc).<br />

Here is the repository of the different pipeline flavours:

 * [Bpipe (NBIS GAAS)](bpipe)
 * Nextflow
     * [NBIS GAAS](nextflow)
     * [nf-core](https://github.com/nf-core/tools)
 * (Please add link to your repo here)

Lot of pipelines framework exists. Here you will find an extensive list of them:
